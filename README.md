Getting started with Embedded Systems# Sample
Autonomous driving vehicles, sensor hub, smart locks, â€¦ The endless possibilities of embedded systems are truly incredible but can also make them surprisingly complex. It is a difficult subject to get started with as it encompasses a wide range of domains and therefore requires a strong set of skills. In this series of articles, I intend to go through the different components required to build an Embedded System.
The overall plan for this series will be as follow:

Introduction to Embedded Systems
Hardware: Microcontrollers
Hardware: Schematic, PCB design, Manufacturing
Networking: Bluetooth, Wifi, Zigbee
Mechanical engineering: 3d printing, enclosure, thermal testing
Software: Embedded specific software, RTOS, Linux
Backend/Frontend: database, website, application
Bonus: sensors, actuators
